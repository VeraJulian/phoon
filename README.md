# phoon
 Write a program, phoon.c, that reports the age or phase of the moon based on an argument-based date.
Assume that the day range is 1-31, month range is 1-12, and year is 1900-2099. If the -a switch is thrown, the
moon’s age is printed as an integer. Otherwise is prints the common western description of the moon’s phase:
age              name
0,1,29           new
2,3,4,5,6        waxing crescent
7,8 first        quarter
9,10,11,12,13    waxing gibbous
14,15,16         full
17,18,19,20,21   waning gibbous
22,23,           third quarter
24,25,26,27,28   waning crescent
